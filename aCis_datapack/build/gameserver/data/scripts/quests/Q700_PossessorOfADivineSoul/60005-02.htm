My daughter Catherine Van Clauss suffers from a grave illness, the same as Kassandra from Rune Castle Town. She was always strong, but her nightmares are robbing her of what all strength she has left.<br>
She was born with a special gift to foresee the future in her dreams. Sansa thinks you might be able to help, so I asked you to come. She knows all the details, talk to her.
