Excellent! I need a very rare herb called Ascended Moss that can only be gathered once every five year. I can tell you an easy way to get it, however. Go to the Swamp of Screams east of here and kill thetop demons. Cut them open and you'll find the herb! I must have five units of it. May the Star of Destiny guide your path!
