<html><body>Arnold Van Clauss:<br>
Have you heard the song about the King of Gracia that fight against... my family...and unified the kingdom? Everyone in Aden and Elmore knows that one! I'm afraid many of the details have been lost to history. It was a beautiful and strange song, sung by the bards in the time of Emperor Baium. Now it's been forgotten.<br>
I've heard that a Dark elf female in Schuttgart has captured the song in an Echo Crystal. She's known as a Melody Sorceress. Find her and bring me the crystal. It will be a great help.
