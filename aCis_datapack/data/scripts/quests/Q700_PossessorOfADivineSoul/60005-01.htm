I've been waiting for you.<br>
You've undertaken the trial as the ranking guild member, and helped Reorin save his wife's soul and restore his reputation and help Virgil and Kassandra too. You don't have to live the life of a criminal anymore. Drinking Mimir's Elixir allows you to create your own destiny. It was no coincidence that my nephew met you. It all matches my daughter's dream!<br>
