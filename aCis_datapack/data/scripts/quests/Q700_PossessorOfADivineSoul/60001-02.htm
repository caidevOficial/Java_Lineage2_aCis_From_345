I don't know if you met Emil Van Clauss, and maybe he knowed the ascended family. He's too old. He dedicated all his life to read ancients manuscript and became the most intelligent man of Elmoreeden to protect the seal that protect the secret of that family. He would know what happened, he know everything. It's very grumpy, so watch yourself!
