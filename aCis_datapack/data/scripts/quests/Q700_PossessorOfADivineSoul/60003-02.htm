My family it's Ascended? what means that? Anyway, The Echo Crystal is a fragile object and is easily broken. This one is worn out after so many years, and needs to be restored. It's delicate work requiring specialized tools. I'll need the long and sturdy claws of Minor Demons from the Frozen Labyrinth.<br>
Bring me ten Demonic claws. Make sure they are in excellent condition!
