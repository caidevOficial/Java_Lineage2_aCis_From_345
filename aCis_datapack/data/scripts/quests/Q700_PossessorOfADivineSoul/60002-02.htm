The Demon Diabolo was best at telling stories and keeping records. He kept journals even during our difficult travels. He can tell you where to find what Arnold is looking for.<br>
One problem remains, He has lost his mind and turned into an evil and powerfull creature and can't tell the stories anymore. He's the only one,  besides me, who knows what really happened, and it's heart-breaking.<br>
There is hope yet. He still has the records. Find him in the area of the Forge of the Gods and take them from him. That's all I know. Good luck!
